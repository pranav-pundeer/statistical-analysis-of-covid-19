# statistical-analysis-of-covid-19

This project report will mainly be taking up the following studies:
Using the covid19india library in rstudio to test that if the onset of the vaccination drive in India has been successful in depreciating the daily cases of covid-19 and the daily deaths caused by the same. We will be observing the data accumulated from the june of 2021 till the current time period.
Also, using the data obtained from a comma separated values (csv) file containing covid cases from 2020 from across the globe , we will test the notion that older people in the population who contracted the virus at a given time, are more likely to die because of it, as compared to the younger members of the same population sample who also acquired the virus during the same period.
We will also address and test the idea that mortality due to the covid-19 infection is higher in males than that in females belonging to the same population sample.

-> R file for the project contains the RStudio code that was written for the analysis.

-> I have also attached the project report and interferences of the analysis in a PDF file which can be downloaded locally for a better view.
